            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Jaylen Cooper </span> from <span className="purple">Virginia, USA.</span>
            <br/>
            My goal is to use technology to create real, positive impactâ€”building solutions that are efficient, scalable, and truly improve lives. 
            I believe in continuous growth: always learning, staying curious, and evolving both as a developer and as a person. 
            I'm passionate about emerging technologies, but even more committed to using them responsibly. 
            I strive to support others, share knowledge, and leave every project, team, and environment better than I found it.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
